User Management
====================


Creating a Super Admin Account
================================

.. include:: user/create-superadmin.txt

Once done, you can now login to your Netmaker server and create additional users.

Configuring User Permissions
==============================

User management is done through the Netmaker dashboard, under the Users (or Manage Account, for SaaS) section from the left navigation bar.
Only server admins have access to this section and can promote users to admin status. The superadmin/tenant owner can both promote and demote users to admin status.

Normal users do not have access to the dashboard and are recommended to use our Remote Access Client to connect to the network.
An admin must aforehand grant such users permission to certain networks by assigning them to remote access gateways however. View the "Remote Access" section for more information on this.

User creation
-------------

To create a new user, click the "Add a User" button on the Users page. Fill in the user's details and click "Create User".

Oauth Users
-----------

Users are also allowed to join a Netmaker server via OAuth. They can do this by clicking the "Login with SSO" button on the dashboard's login page.

From v0.23.1, new accounts would be added to a pending list and would require approval from an admin before they can access any resource. This version also allows whielisting of email domains for OAuth users.
Server admins can do that by adding a comma-separated list of domains to the `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` environment variable. eg: `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=example.net,example.com`
